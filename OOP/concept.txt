OOP focuses on the objects that are
required to be manipulated instead of logic. 
- It makes development and maintenance easier
- It provides data hiding
- It provides ability to simulate real-world
- less memory and organized
- reusable

OOP language follow 4 principles:
1-ENCAPSULATION: We can hide direct access
to data by using private key and we can access
private data by using getter and
setter method. in my framework I have POJO
class which I use it when we need to represent
some data as Java object. So to that we need to 
create a Java class to represent it's data.
So in POJO class I use encapsulation and 
getter setter method to access them.

2-ABSTRACTION: It is a process of hiding
implementation details and showing only
functionality to the user. Abstraction lets
you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.
In my framework I have created my
PageBase class as super
class of the all page classes. 
I have collected all common elements
and functions into PageBase class and
all other page classes extent PageBase class.
By doing so, I don't have to locate very
common WebElements and it provides
reusability in my framework.

3-INHERITANCE: It is used to define the
relationship between two classes. When a
child class acquires all properties and
behaviors of parent class known as inheritance.
Child class can reuse all the codes written
in parent class. It provides the code
reusability. in my framework I have
a TestBase class which I store 
all my reusable code and methods.
My test execution classes and 
elements classes will extend the
TestBase in order to reuse the code.

4-: POLYMORPHISM: It is an ability of object
to behave in multiple form. The most common use
of polymorphism is Java, when a parent class reference
type of variable is used to refer to a child
class object.
I use polymorphis almost everywhere
It is an ability of object to behave in multiple
form. The most common use of polymorphism is Java, when a
parent class reference type of variable
is used to refer to a child class object.
E.g.: WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
JavaScriptExecuter js = (JavaScriptExecuter)Driver.getDriver;
TakeScreenshot screen = (TakeScreenshot)Driver.getDriver;
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
